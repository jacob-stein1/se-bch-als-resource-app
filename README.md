## Getting Started

## ALS Resource App

### Project Description
People with ALS around the world are not offered a variety of clinical options. There are dozens of opportunities for what could be the most beneficial option to them, but are usually only offered a few.  The goal is to take clinical decision making and turn it into a tool that allows ALS patients to look at options and discuss them with their clinician (I have questions about a, b, and c). This tool/guide will allow people with ALS and clinicians/clinics to collaborate in the process of identifying best options throughout the disease process. Tools, resources, and methodologies are continually evolving to help people with ALS to cope with their condition. Because of the rapid nature of development(s), communicating updated resources to both clinicians and patients is difficult. 

The two primary users of this application (mobile or web app) would be patients with ALS or clinicians who work with ALS patients on occasion (such as primary care physicians etc).  The goal would be to provide them with a guided system that is constantly updated with the latest information. Each answer to a question or series of questions would lead the user down a different branch of questions and finally suggestions for the patient's current condition. The end goal would be creating a platform that helps distribute the information to patients and clinicians who might not have access to clinics with ALS experts.

### Extendability

1) Database: The code for storing the data in a database (for this code it is mongodb) has been provided. Since it was not required to do so for our project, we did not do so but for future teams, they can modify this code data storage.

2) Deployment on cloud: The application can easily be deployed on a cloud provider. The tests help users see if the code breaks or not. Furthemore, they can view our CI/CI workflows for cloudflare/vercel to deploy this app.

3) Code modification: We have written modular code written, dividing code into components and classes. Furthermore, detailed explanations for each class can be provided below and on the application.

### Bugs and errors

- Our tests do not run during deployment due to dependency issues. However, we can run it during development by calling npm run test.

- UseEffect gets called twice during dev. Therefore, the back button may appear sooner, cause the page title not to render correctly. Useeffect is not a good option. Thus, we solved this in dev branch by using dynamic routes. It reroute to previous page when user clicks back button. <br><br> 

- In dev branch, we used dynamic routes because it makes our code cleaner and easier to follow. In addition, it creates a page for each question. However, it currently can only be deployed as a dynamic website. To make it a static site, next team would need to usegetstatic paths to generate all pages during build. (Note: our teammate believes we should keep it dynamic as generating all pages at once wastes resources)

- Our page rendering performance can be improved by using possibly dynamic routes (working starter code in dev branch). In addition, the back button is difficult to press. Thus, usecallback can also be useful there. 

- When the page load is slow, it does not show a loading icon

This is the back button

### Summary of we did
Branch: main: <br>
-used strapi to update questions, choices, and resource page content <br>
-resource page includes vidoes, paragraphs, pdf and website links all fetched from strapi <br>
-created a dynamic questionaire <br>
Branch: dev:<br>
-created dynamic routes for each question. Used routeback to navigate to previous page after clickling back button <br>
-starter code for saving content into mongodb after clickling on save button <br>

### Deployment

We deployed the frontend in vercel. The link the test can be found in the side of the repo
https://se-bch-als-resource-app.vercel.app/

In addition, we deployed strapi on railway
